# Neural Networks

## Layers

Neural networks are made up of layers. Each layer has a set of neurons, or nodes, that process input data. There are different types of layers (dense(fully connected), convolutional, recurrent, etc.). Each layer has a specific role in processing the input.

## Forward Pass

The forward pass is the process that the neural netwwork uses to pass input data from one layer to the other in sequence. In the forward pass, input data is put through linear and non-linear operations 

## Loss Function

Loss functions measure how well the neural netowrk is performing in labeling data as true or false. 

## Weights & Biases

Weights and biases are parameters within each neuron of the neural network. The neural network adjusts these in training to optimize performance. It's what the neural network finds when looking for patterns within data and what it uses to percieve input data. 

## Optimization Algorithm

This is for optimizing the adjustmenet of weights and biases during training. Common examples are stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, etc. 

## Activiation Functions

Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network. They decide the output of a neuron based on its weighted sum of inputs. Common activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, softmax, and more.

## Learning Rate

The learning rate decides how much the weights and biases of a neural network are adjusted in training. A larger learning rate results in larger steps, while a smaller learning rate leads to smaller steps.
